# LOOPS

- Exercise 1:

Create a new script.<br>
Create a variable x and give it the value 0.<br>
Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.<br>

 - Exercise 2:

Create a new script.<br>
Copy the code below into your script.<br>
for i in range(10):<br>

 do something here<br>

Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.<br>
Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.<br>
Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.<br>

- Exercise 3:

Create a new script.<br>
Copy the array below into your script.<br>
arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]<br>

Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.<br>
