# Data types and comments

Exercise 1:

- Create a new script. <br>

- Copy the code below into your script.<br>
a = 'int'<br>
b = 7<br>
c = False<br>
d = "18.5"<br>
- Determine the data types of all four variables ( a, b, c, d) using a built-in function.<br>
- Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.<br>
- Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.<br>


Exercise 2:

- Create a new script.<br>
- Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.<br>
- Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).<br>

<b>Float</b> <br>
A floating-point number is a decimal number. <br>
floating_point = 18.5 <br>

<b>Comments</b> are lines that do not get processed as code. This can be used for multiple purposes. For example, you can write a short description of what a block of code does. You can also ‘comment out’ some code, so that it is temporarily removed. This can be useful for testing and debugging.
