# Exercise 1 / Loops

# Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
x = 0

# Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration.
# After printing, the value of x should increase by 1.
# The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.
while x <= 10:
    print("Value of x:", x)
    x += 1  # Increase the value of x by 1 in each iteration


# in short:
        
x = 0

while x <= 10:
    print("Value of x:", x)
    x += 1
