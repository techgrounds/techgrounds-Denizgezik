   # Exercise 2

# Using the for loop, print the value of i in each iteration.
for i in range(10):
    # do something here
    print("Value of i:", i)
    
 

# Add a variable x with the value 5 at the top of your script.
x = 5

# Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.
for i in range(50):
    result = x * i
    print("Value of x * i:", result)
