- CloudFront

- Route53


## Key-terms
- console = controlepaneel
- bursting = temporary peaks in traffic 
- POSIX = Portable Operating System Interface

- EFS:  

it's a simple fully managed cloud native file system. EFS provides serverless shared storage so you dont need to provision or manage any infrastructure or capacity. 

 With Amazon EFS, you pay only for the storage used by your file system and there is no minimum fee or setup cost. Amazon EFS offers the following storage class options for different use cases:

<b>Standard storage classes (Recommended) </b> – EFS Standard and EFS Standard–Infrequent Access (Standard–IA), which offer Multi-AZ resilience and the highest levels of durability and availability.

<b>One Zone storage classes </b>– EFS One Zone and EFS One Zone–Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone–IA), which offer you the choice of additional savings by choosing to save your data in a single Availability Zone.

The service is designed to be highly scalable, highly available, and highly durable. Amazon EFS file systems using Standard storage classes store data and metadata across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region. EFS file systems can grow to petabyte scale, drive high levels of throughput, and allow massively parallel access from compute instances to your data.

<b>EFS maintains posix files permissions!</b>


- RDS/Aurora

RDS = Relational Database Service

A managing database system specifically for SQL bases servers or relational database servers.<br>
AWS manages/ maintains underlying infrastructure.<br>
Makes it easy to configure database however you'd like.<br>
Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL server.<br>
Integrates nicely with other AWS Services. <br>

Horizontal scaling.
