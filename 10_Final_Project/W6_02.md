## Dagverslag (1 zin)
Busy with adding "Launch Template" & "Target Group". 

## Obstakels
This week I would like to create:
- Launch Template
- Target Group
- Auto Scaling Group
- Load Balancer
- Listener

## Oplossingen
The AWS documemtation is not really handy regarding these constructs:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2/ApplicationTargetGroup.html

ChatGPT gives better options. Gemini as well. 

## Learnings

Why do we need 'Launch Template'? <br>
If you plan to use an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to manage your web server instances in your CDK code, you definitely need a Launch Template.

Auto Scaling Groups require explicit details about the instances it should launch. With Launch Templates, you define and maintain all necessary configuration in a single, reusable template, avoiding repetitive specifications within your ASG definition.

Launch Templates offer versioning, allowing you to manage different configurations effectively and roll back changes if needed. This becomes crucial when scaling your ASG horizontally.


What's the function of a Target Group?

A Target Group in AWS serves as a mechanism for directing traffic from a load balancer to a pool of backend instances. It acts as a logical grouping of healthy instances that are ready to receive traffic. Here's a breakdown of its key functions:

 1. Instance Health Management:

Target Groups monitor the health status of associated instances through customizable health checks. These checks can be configured to verify if the instance is responsive, functioning correctly, and ready to handle traffic.
Based on the health check results, a Target Group dynamically includes healthy instances in the routing pool and removes unhealthy ones, ensuring traffic only reaches available and functioning instances.
 
 2. Traffic Routing:

Target Groups are linked to specific Load Balancers. When a request arrives at the Load Balancer, it consults the associated Target Group to determine the appropriate target instance for routing the traffic.
You can configure different routing strategies within a Target Group, such as round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution, influencing how traffic is divided among the healthy instances.
 
 3. Scaling and Flexibility:

Target Groups facilitate seamless scaling of your application. When you add new instances to your infrastructure, you simply register them with the relevant Target Group. The Load Balancer automatically starts directing traffic to them, expanding your application's capacity.
Similarly, when you need to remove instances for maintenance or scaling down, deregistering them from the Target Group ensures they no longer receive traffic.
 
 4. Application Targeting:

You can create multiple Target Groups to group instances based on specific criteria, such as instance type, application version, or intended functionality. This allows you to direct traffic based on specific needs, like routing requests to instances running a specific version of your application.
A Target Groups act as the bridge between Load Balancers and your backend instances, offering granular control over traffic distribution, ensuring application health, and enabling dynamic scaling capabilities within your AWS environment.
