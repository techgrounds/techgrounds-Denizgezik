## Dagverslag (1 zin)
Whole day busy trying to test if autoscling really works..

## Obstakels
Couldn't get it work with the right script in my user data

## Oplossingen
First manually launched an instance in my console to see if the user data is working by testing it line by line from the script.

## Learnings
How to test first in stead of just copy pasting scripts for user data's and see if they are up to date..
