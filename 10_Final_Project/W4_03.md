# Log [31-01-2024]

(On the 2nd of February the screen of my laptop stopped working. I lost a part of my data which was saved locally. Why i had to save my Techgrounds file locally is for the reason that otherwise i could not work in the terminal of VSC directly from my iCloud. I have to fill in these logs again and try to remember what happened on this particular day which is really hard i must say to recall everything..)
