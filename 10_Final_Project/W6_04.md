## Learnings

-  A Listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. Before you start using your Application Load Balancer, you must add at least one listener. If your load balancer has no listeners, it can't receive traffic from clients. The rules that you define for your listeners determine how the load balancer routes requests to the targets that you register, such as EC2 instances.

- a Listener is a crucial component of an ALB, providing the entry point for incoming traffic and defining how that traffic is routed to the different target groups based on specified rules and configurations.
