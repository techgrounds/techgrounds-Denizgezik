## Dagverslag (1 zin)
Things are getting easier now. Deployed even a working webserver and a management server

## Obstakels
Trying to integrate 3 different methods in 1.

## Oplossingen
Let cdk work for you! 
Because, for example: when you create a vpc "aws cdk" already creates lots of things automatically for you in stead of customising every route or subnet etc.

## Learnings
CDK is a powerful tool. Python as well, but don't use it against yourself by choosing the "for loops" method. 


- At least my webserver is working, finally!
