Found out, during a presentation of a peer, how to add a specific subnet to an ec2 instance, but then a new error popped up saying that the vpc is not specified.

## Obstakels
At the end of the day after the course the screen of my laptop went on black. So the laptop is completely useless even if i connect it to another (LG TV) screen, because after many restarts my laptop ended up in a reboot / restart loop. So the computer is basically still working, but the screen died. A second screen is not conencting unfortunately. 

## Oplossingen
Went to the genius bar at the apple store. They coulnd't fix it as well, unfortunately.

## Learnings
Back up everyday and push your vsc to your github every single day. 
Fortunately i saved my stack also in the cloud, but unfortunately lots of time logs were gone..

## Obstakels
Didn't finish everything yet from my cloud design into IaS.

## Oplossingen
Instead of using for loops in Python it is easier to place my chunks of code separataly one below the other.

## Learnings
Be practical with your solutions if you don't have time :)
