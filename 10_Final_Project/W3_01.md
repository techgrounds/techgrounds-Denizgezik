Tried to create 2 vpcs and a vpc peering. Looked like it worked with cdk synth, not with cdk deploy yet, unfortunately.

## Obstakels
Do i have to create 2 internet gateways, sine i am using 2 vpcs?
It gives an error with the private and public subnets when i try to deploy it in aws.
And when i create 2 different internet gateways it shows another error.

## Oplossingen
Not yet. try to figure out first what i actually need.

## Learnings

- creating the right subnets and route tables and attach them to each other
- make the right decision regarding 1 or 2 internet gateways..
