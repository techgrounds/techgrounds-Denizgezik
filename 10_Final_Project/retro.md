<b>Deniz</b> (i am the scrum master for thise week & the next week):
- deploying my work went well since yesterday, after struggling a lot.
- Keeping up my time logs could be much better. And also Jira.
- I was too long stucked with an error regarding my cidr blocks of my second vpc. It kept saying your (private & public) subnet is invalid. For days i tried to find a solution.
- Teamwork is outstanding.

<b>Zuhair</b> added one more thing:
- We lost too much time finding out what kind of infrastructure we wanted to create and use it as our final diagram.

Overall we do have lots of joy working on this project plus working together as a team, despite the hard times thanks to all the errors!

But without errors, no piece of evolution, i guess.. :nerd_face::upside_down_face:
