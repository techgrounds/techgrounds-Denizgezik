## Learnings

# Retro van [De SlangenBezweerders] van week [5]
Scrum master: Geef iedereen 10 minuten om zijn antwoorden op deze vragen te bedenken. Schrijf daarna de antwoorden op. 


## Wat ging goed?
 - We made a huge switch last Tuesday, 6th of Febr 2024, by recreating & rebuilding our stack. This restart was necessary due to many errors we had to encounter. A fresh start made life more easier when deploying your stack.

## Wat kan beter?
 - We still have to start on v1.1 and are a week behind.

## Wat kunnen wij doen om het te verbeteren?
 - Be more effective. Share constantly your knowledge and help eachother to reach the finish line.
