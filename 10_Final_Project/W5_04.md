## Dagverslag (1 zin)
This early in the morning i finally started with AWS CANVAS (Restart) again. Trying to create a Back Up Plan for my Webserver..

## Obstakels
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_backup.BackupPlan.html 

This kind of documents are not always as useful as you wish, unfortunately..

## Oplossingen

- Used a lot of Chat GPT & Bard (Google) as usual. 

## Learnings

Not a productive day when you also try to make a back up of your laptop on an external drive in between working on your project and it goes wrong because the screen of the previous computer doesn't work anymore and you are trying to keep it "alive", while connecting it to your tv screen as an external desktop screen by mirroring it. It took hours and hours to make a decent back up and at the end it failed, because somehow the laptop gets in a sleeping modus and i canged it in the settings, but apparently it didn't work out well hence the screen issues..
That's why i was completely distracted. 

In the evening i tried to prepare my presentation for tomorrow.
