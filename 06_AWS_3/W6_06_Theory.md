Gain theoretical knowledge of those topics mentioned above.

## Key-terms

ECS:
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. As a fully managed service, Amazon ECS comes with AWS configuration and operational best practices built-in. It's integrated with both AWS and third-party tools, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry and Docker. This integration makes it easier for teams to focus on building the applications, not the environment. You can run and scale your container workloads across AWS Regions in the cloud, and on-premises, without the complexity of managing a control plane.

There are three layers in Amazon ECS:

Capacity - The infrastructure where your containers run <br>
Controller - Deploy and manage your applications that run on the containers <br>
Provisioning - The tools that you can use to interface with the scheduler to deploy and manage your applications and containers<br>
